# LTE_WiFi_coexistence

This project includes Matab source codes for the paper "Towards Fair and Efficient Spectrum Sharing between LTE and WiFi in Unlicensed Bands: Fairness-constrained Throughput Maximization".

THe function "LTE_WiFi_coexistence" simulates the LTE and WiFi networks in coexistence, with the input of system paramenters, and the output of network steady-state points and network throughput.

The file "test" gives an example to plot a figure to demontrate the analytical and simulation results of the network throughput of LTE and WiFi.
